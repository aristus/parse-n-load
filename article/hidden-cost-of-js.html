<h2>A Hidden Cost of Javascript</h2>

<p><b>Hello, this is unfinished. If you'd like to help out, please email me at carlos [a] bueno [d] org. Thanks!</b></p>

<p>Any savvy web developer can tell you how many kilobytes their code consumes. They bundle, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#minify">minify</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#gzip">compress</a> and tune the data sent out to within an inch of its life. Wire weight is easy to measure and has a direct impact on your application's launch time. But how many milliseconds does it take the user's computer to <i>parse and load</i> your code once it's arrived? What differences are there between CPUs, operating systems, browsers and plugins? What speed leaks are we overlooking?</p>

<p>To find out I built a test harness that loads a given block of Javascript over and over and measures the setup time. My test subjects were the Yahoo User Interface (<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3">YUI</a>) libraries, Scriptaculous, jQueryUI, and 280North's Cappuccino framework. By themselves these Javascript files don't do anything except register classes, functions and variables. I've also included the main Javascript application code from popular applications like GitHub and Yahoo Mail. In the case of application code I carefully neutered them to not do initialization or throw errors.</p>


<p>The test is as simple as can be: record a start time, load the script, record the end time, and repeat over 1,000 iterations. The test were run on a recently-booted machine with no other programs running. You can <a href="http://github.com/aristus/parse-n-load">check out the project on GitHub</a> and play along at home.</p>

  <p>* Incomplete test, only 100 iterations. See "Tragic Opera" below.</p>
</div>

<p>You can see there are some large differences between different browsers and libraries on the same hardware and OS. While Google Chrome appears to be an order of magnitude faster at parse-n-load I think the truth is a little more complex. On slower machines this benchmark often produces sharp cliffs. That might be the V8 engine's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching">inline caching</a> kicking in after so many iterations:</p>

  <img src="chrome-cliff.png" />
  <div class="caption">Figure 0: Chrome's V8 parser has two speeds: fast and <b>very</b> fast. MacBook Air 1.6GHz</div>
</div>

<p>Comparing the speed of different libraries in the same browser is trickier because they all have a different feature set. As of this writing YUI2 is much more complete than YUI3, and I only included a few widgets like DataTable and TreeView to create a slug of Javascript of a comparable size.</p>

<p>50-150 milliseconds may not sound like a big deal, but this is a top-of-the line 2009 computer. Users don't have the same expensive gear you do, and parse-n-load time pretty much comes down to the speed of the CPU. There are about 50 million netbooks in the field today and that number is expected to jump into the hundreds of millions over the next few years.</p>

<p>NB: I would take this table with a grain of salt. The machine is a refurbished 1st generation Air with overheating problems. On the other hand, that's just the kind of crap users have to deal with. [todo: reconfirm the scriptaculous ff3 numbers.]</p>


<h3>Debugging the Benchmark</h3>
<p>The first problem that came up was different blocking behavior between browsers. In Safari 4 (but not 3) if you create a script tag that points to an external file, that action will block, ie, wait until that file is completely parsed and loaded. This makes timing it very easy. In Firefox, however, this action asynchronous: the statement that creates the script element returns immediately and the file is loaded in a separate thread. This means you have to set up a callback in the separate thread to both measure elapsed time and kick off the next iteration of the test. You also have to be <a href="http://paulbarry.com/articles/2009/08/30/tail-call-optimization">careful not the blow the stack</a> with too many nested function calls. Chrome is also asynchronous and has an altogether different stack behavior. If all that wasn't enough, browsers have very different memory allocation behavior, of which more (oh, much more) below.</p>

<h3>Adventures in Garbage Collecting</h3>

<p>Every browser seems to have a different system for allocating memory while parsing Javascript code. When you graph the results from Safari 4 this is what you will see:</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="spiky-garbage.png" />
  <div class="caption">Figure 0: the effects of GC halts</div>
</div>


<p>Interesting. All of the source files in the benchmark are local so that's not I/O wait. The regularity of huge spikes suggests that the browser is pausing every so often to free up memory via garbage collection. When you remove those spikes another interesting patterns shows up. Here is the same graph with the top 5% of datapoints removed:</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="sawtooth.png" />
  <div class="caption">Figure 1: 95th percentile graph of Javascript load times in Safari 4</div>
</div>

<p>It appears that the parse-n-load time of a given piece of Javascript in Safari 4 will increase linearly with the amount of garbage. The load time can grow as much as 3X longer than normal before GC kicks in. I'm not certain whether this is an artifact of the benchmark or if it actually happens a lot during real-world use. Other browsers exhibit similar halt-the-world GC behavior but only Safari 4 and Opera 10.5alpha have this sawtooth. Firefox's graph stays fairly horizontal but has many more small spikes:</p>


<div class="figure">
  <img src="firefox-35.png" />
  <div class="caption">Figure 2: 95th percentile graph of Javascript load times in Firefox 3.5.3</div>
</div>



<h3>A Tragic Opera</h3>
<p>The results for Opera 10.0 and Safari 3 have asterixes because I couldn't get them to run the complete test. Opera got steadily slower up to 250 iterations after which it started serious thrashing and had to be killed. Opera 10.5alpha reportedly has a new Javascript engine, and some quick tests show more sawtooth-like behavior, but it still is not able to complete the full 1,000 iterations before spinning out of control.</p>

  <img src="opera-10-ram.png" />
  <div class="caption">Figure 3: Opera 10 choking on the parse-n-load benchmark</div>
</div>

<p>Safari 3 hit the wall even earlier, triggering an Out-of-Memory error after a couple hundred iterations.<p>

<h3>Try this at home</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://github.com/aristus/parse-n-load">Parse-N-Load benchmark</a> is open source and free for use. It's early and I'm sure there are bugs. If you have other kinds of hardware (Netbooks! Windows! Linux!), please try it out and let me know what you find.</p>
